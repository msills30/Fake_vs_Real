"Taylor Swift, beloved by millions, had always wielded immense influence over her dedicated fanbase. But on a fateful day in the heart of a bustling city, something unexpected unfolded: Swifties, as her fans affectionately called themselves, became the driving force behind a coup d'état, propelled by their unwavering devotion to their idol.
It began innocently enough, with a simple tweet from Taylor herself, expressing her disillusionment with the status quo of politics and society. Little did she know, this tweet would spark a revolution. Swifties, united by their admiration for Taylor and emboldened by her call for change, took to the streets, their banners emblazoned with lyrics from her empowering anthems.
Their coup was unconventional, fueled not by violence but by passion and determination. They organized peaceful protests, occupying government buildings and demanding reform. Social media became their battlefield, where they waged a war of words and hashtags, spreading their message far and wide.
Swift herself became the figurehead of this movement, her every word and action scrutinized by the media and her followers alike. Her music, once seen as mere entertainment, now served as an anthem for a generation demanding justice and equality.
As the days passed, the momentum of the Swiftie revolution grew, drawing in supporters from all walks of life. Politicians, celebrities, and ordinary citizens alike rallied behind Taylor and her fans, inspired by their unwavering dedication to their cause.
In the end, it wasn't just about overthrowing a government—it was about creating a better world, one where voices were heard and change was possible. And though the road ahead was fraught with challenges, the Swifties stood strong, their allegiance to Taylor and each other unwavering.
In the annals of history, the Swiftie coup d'état would be remembered not for the chaos it wrought, but for the hope it inspired and the change it brought about. And Taylor Swift, the pop sensation turned revolutionary leader, would forever be hailed as the voice of a generation.",Fake
"InIn the galaxy of Warhammer 40,000, the Imperium of Man is built off the backs of transhuman soldiers. There are the iconic Space Marines, who are gene-crafted and mass produced by the Emperor of Mankind, but when you need something a little more specialized, you might turn to the Adeptus Custodes. This group stands 10,000 strong, and each is a work of art. These philosopher warriors serve as the personal guards and agents of the Emperor, even in his currently skeletal state.
These warriors are super strong, incredibly fast, and incorruptible by Chaos. But one question lingered: Can they be women? According to one recent X post from the official Warhammer account, the answer is yes, which means the Custodes are now the subject of social media debate.It was only in 2017 with seventh edition, alongside the launch of the current lore era, that they have become their own fieldable army that players can run alongside Tyranids, Necrons, or Astra Militarum. The bananas, as they’re often fondly referred to by the fan base, are popular because they’re a cost-efficient way for new players to get into the game. If someone isn’t up to the task of painting dozens or hundreds of little guys, painting just a few golden Custodes is a much less daunting, much more affordable task. They’re also the favored army of Henry Cavill, who is currently working on a 40K adaptation with Amazon.If you’re a Custodes fan, you likely enjoy how buff and wise these soldiers are. Meanwhile, the haters tend to dislike how the Custodes are super-super-soldiers in a setting already so dominated by Space Marines. In the arms race to have continually bigger boys, the Custodes are the absolute peak of the Imperium’s power scale.
The faction was originally depicted as being exclusively male. After the Emperor united the warring factions of Earth under the Imperium’s banner over 10,000 years ago, he began a tradition where the noble houses would give up their firstborn infant sons to become material to make Custodes. But the most recent 10th-edition codex includes a point-of-view piece of lore from Calladayce Taurovalia Kesh, who uses she/her pronouns. Some fans wondered if this was a Sister of Silence (Custodes work hand in hand with this mysterious order of mute women with a powerful immunity to the Warp), but the official Warhammer account confirmed that she was actually a female Custodes.
The Custodes have been around since Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, the original version of the game published in 1987. The Custodes are 10-foot-tall transhuman super-warriors, crafted from an infant, gene-forgery, and Warp Magic, and built to serve the Emperor on Terra. They literally can’t disagree with the Emperor, which is quite funny since the faction brags about their intellectual prowess so often.",Fake
"A team of scientists from Columbia, Nanjing University, Princeton, and the University of Munster, writing in the journal Nature, have presented the first experimental evidence of collective excitations with spin called chiral graviton modes (CGMs) in a semiconducting material. A CGM appears to be similar to a graviton, a yet-to-be-discovered elementary particle better known in high-energy quantum physics for hypothetically giving rise to gravity, one of the fundamental forces in the universe, whose ultimate cause remains mysterious.

The ability to study graviton-like particles in the lab could help fill critical gaps between quantum mechanics and Einstein’s theories of relativity, solving a major dilemma in physics and expanding our understanding of the universe.

“Our experiment marks the first experimental substantiation of this concept of gravitons, posited by pioneering works in quantum gravity since the 1930s, in a condensed matter system,” said Lingjie Du, a former Columbia postdoc and senior author on the paper.

The team discovered the particle in a type of condensed matter called a fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) liquid. FQHE liquids are a system of strongly interacting electrons that occur in two dimensions at high magnetic fields and low temperatures. They can be theoretically described using quantum geometry, emerging mathematical concepts that apply to the minute physical distances at which quantum mechanics influences physical phenomena. Electrons in an FQHE are subject to what’s known as a quantum metric that had been predicted to give rise to CGMs in response to light. However, in the decade since the quantum metric theory was first proposed for FQHEs, limited experimental techniques existed to test its predictions.

For much of his career, the Columbia physicist Aron Pinczuk studied the mysteries of FQHE liquids and worked to develop experimental tools that could probe such complex quantum systems. Pinczuk, who joined Columbia from Bell Labs in 1998 and was a professor of physics and applied physics, passed away in 2022, but his lab and its alumni across the globe have continued his legacy. Those alumni include article authors Ziyu Liu, who graduated with his PhD in physics from Columbia last year, and former Columbia postdocs Du, now at Nanjing University, and Ursula Wurstbauer, now at the University of Münster.“Aron pioneered the approach of studying exotic phases of matter, including emergent quantum phases in solid state nanosystems, by the low-lying collective excitation spectra that are their unique fingerprints,” commented Wurstbauer, a co-author on the current work. “I am truly happy that his last genius proposal and research idea was so successful and is now published in Nature. However, it is sad that he cannot celebrate it with us. He always put a strong focus on the people behind the results.”

One of the techniques Pinczuk established was called low-temperature resonant inelastic scattering, which measures how light particles, or photons, scatter when they hit a material, thus revealing the material’s underlying properties. Liu and his co-authors on the Nature paper adapted the technique to use what’s known as circularly polarized light, in which the photons have a particular spin. When the polarized photons interact with a particle like a CGM that also spins, the sign of the photons’ spin will change in response in a more distinctive way than if they were interacting with other types of modes. 

The new paper in Nature was an international collaboration. Using samples prepared by Pinczuk’s long-time collaborators at Princeton, Liu and Columbia physicist Cory Dean completed a series of measurements at Columbia. They then sent the sample for experiments in low-temperature optical equipment that Du spent over three years building in his new lab in China. They observed physical properties consistent with those predicted by quantum geometry for CGMs, including their spin-2 nature, characteristic energy gaps between its ground and excited states, and dependence on so-called filling factors, which relate the number of electrons in the system to its magnetic field. 

CGMs share those characteristics with gravitons, a still-undiscovered particle predicted to play a critical role in gravity. Both CGMs and gravitons are the result of quantized metric fluctuations, explained Liu, in which the fabric of spacetime is randomly pulled and stretched in different directions. The theory behind the team’s results can therefore potentially connect two subfields of physics: high energy physics, which operates across the largest scales of the universe, and condensed matter physics, which studies materials and the atomic and electronic interactions that give them their unique properties. 

In future work, Liu says the polarized light technique should be straightforward to apply to FQHE liquids at higher energy levels than they explored in the current paper. It should also apply to additional types of quantum systems where quantum geometry predicts unique properties from collective particles, such as superconductors. 

“For a long time, there was this mystery about how long wavelength collective modes, like CGMs, could be probed in experiments. We provide experimental evidence that supports quantum geometry predictions,” said Liu. “I think Aron would be very proud to see this extension of his techniques and new understanding of a system he had studied for a long time.”",Real
"Former President Trump slammed Columbia University for closing its campus amid violent anti-Israel, pro-Gaza protests, urging the college to ""gain a little strength"" and ""courage,"" while saying the move ""means the other side wins."" 
Trump took reporter questions in Trump Tower on Tuesday evening before a meeting with former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso, who is the current vice president of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party.Former President Trump slammed Columbia University for closing its campus amid violent anti-Israel, pro-Gaza protests, urging the college to ""gain a little strength"" and ""courage,"" while saying the move ""means the other side wins."" 
Trump took reporter questions in Trump Tower on Tuesday evening before a meeting with former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso, who is the current vice president of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party.  ""Well, we have a lot of different things, but what’s going on with the colleges—and, they’re closing Columbia now? I mean, it’s just crazy,"" Trump said. ""Columbia should gain a little strength, a little courage and keep their school open."" 
Trump’s comments came after students at Columbia University were instructed that classes had shifted to virtual or hybrid amid ongoing safety concerns stemming from the anti-Israel protests filling the campus. 
""It’s crazy because that means the other side wins,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""When you start closing down colleges and universities—that means the other side [wins.]"" The former president, pointing to Aso and Japan said ""in Japan, they don’t know about that. They don’t close. They keep it open. They make it work."" 
""The people running Columbia have made a grave mistake,"" Trump said. Columbia University’s updated guidelines, as of Tuesday morning, said all courses on the Morningside main campus have moved to hybrid learning ""until the end of each school’s Spring 2024 semester.""
""Safety is our highest priority as we strive to support our students’ learning and all the required academic operations,"" the school's Provost Angela Olinto wrote in a statement released early Tuesday morning. ""It’s vital that teaching and learning continue during this time.""The announcement comes amid continued antisemitic protests on the New York City campus and just a day after classes were made virtual on Monday.
The guidance, signed in tandem with Chief Operating Officer Cas Holloway, also affects faculty and staff.
The guidance comes amid days of protests at Columbia, where anti-Israel agitators initially formed an encampment — setting up tents and refusing to leave— on the campus last week. The protesters have marched in and around the campus demanding the school lose affiliations with groups that support Israel amid its war with Hamas in Gaza, which has resulted in tens of thousands of civilian deaths.  Columbia University President Dr. Nemat ""Minouche"" Shafik said in a statement posted in the early hours Monday morning, that she was ""deeply saddened"" by certain actions of the agitators and called for a ""reset.""""I am deeply saddened by what is happening on our campus,"" Shafik wrote. ""Our bonds as a community have been severely tested in ways that will take a great deal of time and effort to reaffirm. Students across an array of communities have conveyed fears for their safety and we have announced additional actions we are taking to address security concerns. The decibel of our disagreements has only increased in recent days. These tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas.""Shafik, on Monday, said the university needs ""a reset."" 
More than 100 of the protesters were arrested last week amid the unrest.Antisemitic protests have broken out at colleges and universities across the nation including New York University in New York City and Yale University in New Haven, Ct. ",Real
"WASHINGTON — The Senate voted Tuesday to advance the $95 billion aid package to provide critical aid to Ukraine and a provision that could lead to a nationwide ban on TikTok.
The vote of 80-19 indicates the legislation has enough support to clear the Senate in a final vote, which could come as soon as Tuesday evening, and then head to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law.
The package, which passed the House on Saturday, includes $60 billion in aid to Ukraine that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said would give his country “a chance at victory” against Russia. It includes $26 billion in aid to Israel and humanitarian relief in Gaza, in addition to $8 billion for security in Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific.
And it would give TikTok’s China-based parent company nine months, which the president could extend to a year, to sell the popular social media platform or be banned in the U.S. That puts TikTok closer than ever before to a prohibition while ensuring that it won’t be banned until after the 2024 election.Senators on Tuesday afternoon will discuss whether they can reach a deal to quickly vote to give final passage to the bill later in the day or whether to wait until Wednesday to approve it.
“The finish line is now in sight,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement over the weekend, saying the bill’s passage would be “a watershed moment for the defense of democracy.”Two months ago, the Senate voted 70-29 to pass a similar $95 billion foreign aid package — but without the TikTok provision.
Still, there are signs that the Senate is receptive to the TikTok ban bill, which the House revised.
Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., the chair of the Commerce Committee, endorsed the new bill, saying she’s “very happy” with the extended window for TikTok to be sold. An earlier House-passed bill would have given the parent company six months to sell TikTok. Cantwell noted that she recommended the change.
""I support this updated legislation,"" she said.
Advocates for banning the app in the U.S. express concerns about TikTok’s relationship to ByteDance, a company based in Beijing, saying Americans’ data could, under Chinese law, be accessed by China’s government, a prospect that TikTok has downplayed, saying its headquarters are in Singapore and Los Angeles. They also claim China could manipulate the algorithm to advance propaganda.
A TikTok spokesperson responded to the House’s vote over the weekend by saying, “It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy annually.” 
A source within TikTok said in a memo sent after the House passed the bill that once Biden signs it into law, it ""will move to the courts for a legal challenge.""
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is lobbying his colleagues to reject the package, saying 41 senators could join to filibuster it.
“The $95 billion bill doesn’t have to pass. It takes only 41 senators stop it,” Lee wrote on X. “There are 49 Republicans in the Senate—more than enough. Where do your senators stand?”",Real
