"A team of scientists from Columbia, Nanjing University, Princeton, and the University of Munster, writing in the journal Nature, have presented the first experimental evidence of collective excitations with spin called chiral graviton modes (CGMs) in a semiconducting material. A CGM appears to be similar to a graviton, a yet-to-be-discovered elementary particle better known in high-energy quantum physics for hypothetically giving rise to gravity, one of the fundamental forces in the universe, whose ultimate cause remains mysterious.

The ability to study graviton-like particles in the lab could help fill critical gaps between quantum mechanics and Einstein’s theories of relativity, solving a major dilemma in physics and expanding our understanding of the universe.

“Our experiment marks the first experimental substantiation of this concept of gravitons, posited by pioneering works in quantum gravity since the 1930s, in a condensed matter system,” said Lingjie Du, a former Columbia postdoc and senior author on the paper.

The team discovered the particle in a type of condensed matter called a fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) liquid. FQHE liquids are a system of strongly interacting electrons that occur in two dimensions at high magnetic fields and low temperatures. They can be theoretically described using quantum geometry, emerging mathematical concepts that apply to the minute physical distances at which quantum mechanics influences physical phenomena. Electrons in an FQHE are subject to what’s known as a quantum metric that had been predicted to give rise to CGMs in response to light. However, in the decade since the quantum metric theory was first proposed for FQHEs, limited experimental techniques existed to test its predictions.

For much of his career, the Columbia physicist Aron Pinczuk studied the mysteries of FQHE liquids and worked to develop experimental tools that could probe such complex quantum systems. Pinczuk, who joined Columbia from Bell Labs in 1998 and was a professor of physics and applied physics, passed away in 2022, but his lab and its alumni across the globe have continued his legacy. Those alumni include article authors Ziyu Liu, who graduated with his PhD in physics from Columbia last year, and former Columbia postdocs Du, now at Nanjing University, and Ursula Wurstbauer, now at the University of Münster.“Aron pioneered the approach of studying exotic phases of matter, including emergent quantum phases in solid state nanosystems, by the low-lying collective excitation spectra that are their unique fingerprints,” commented Wurstbauer, a co-author on the current work. “I am truly happy that his last genius proposal and research idea was so successful and is now published in Nature. However, it is sad that he cannot celebrate it with us. He always put a strong focus on the people behind the results.”

One of the techniques Pinczuk established was called low-temperature resonant inelastic scattering, which measures how light particles, or photons, scatter when they hit a material, thus revealing the material’s underlying properties. Liu and his co-authors on the Nature paper adapted the technique to use what’s known as circularly polarized light, in which the photons have a particular spin. When the polarized photons interact with a particle like a CGM that also spins, the sign of the photons’ spin will change in response in a more distinctive way than if they were interacting with other types of modes. 

The new paper in Nature was an international collaboration. Using samples prepared by Pinczuk’s long-time collaborators at Princeton, Liu and Columbia physicist Cory Dean completed a series of measurements at Columbia. They then sent the sample for experiments in low-temperature optical equipment that Du spent over three years building in his new lab in China. They observed physical properties consistent with those predicted by quantum geometry for CGMs, including their spin-2 nature, characteristic energy gaps between its ground and excited states, and dependence on so-called filling factors, which relate the number of electrons in the system to its magnetic field. 

CGMs share those characteristics with gravitons, a still-undiscovered particle predicted to play a critical role in gravity. Both CGMs and gravitons are the result of quantized metric fluctuations, explained Liu, in which the fabric of spacetime is randomly pulled and stretched in different directions. The theory behind the team’s results can therefore potentially connect two subfields of physics: high energy physics, which operates across the largest scales of the universe, and condensed matter physics, which studies materials and the atomic and electronic interactions that give them their unique properties. 

In future work, Liu says the polarized light technique should be straightforward to apply to FQHE liquids at higher energy levels than they explored in the current paper. It should also apply to additional types of quantum systems where quantum geometry predicts unique properties from collective particles, such as superconductors. 

“For a long time, there was this mystery about how long wavelength collective modes, like CGMs, could be probed in experiments. We provide experimental evidence that supports quantum geometry predictions,” said Liu. “I think Aron would be very proud to see this extension of his techniques and new understanding of a system he had studied for a long time.”",Real
"Former President Trump slammed Columbia University for closing its campus amid violent anti-Israel, pro-Gaza protests, urging the college to ""gain a little strength"" and ""courage,"" while saying the move ""means the other side wins."" 
Trump took reporter questions in Trump Tower on Tuesday evening before a meeting with former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso, who is the current vice president of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party.Former President Trump slammed Columbia University for closing its campus amid violent anti-Israel, pro-Gaza protests, urging the college to ""gain a little strength"" and ""courage,"" while saying the move ""means the other side wins."" 
Trump took reporter questions in Trump Tower on Tuesday evening before a meeting with former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso, who is the current vice president of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party.  ""Well, we have a lot of different things, but what’s going on with the colleges—and, they’re closing Columbia now? I mean, it’s just crazy,"" Trump said. ""Columbia should gain a little strength, a little courage and keep their school open."" 
Trump’s comments came after students at Columbia University were instructed that classes had shifted to virtual or hybrid amid ongoing safety concerns stemming from the anti-Israel protests filling the campus. 
""It’s crazy because that means the other side wins,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""When you start closing down colleges and universities—that means the other side [wins.]"" The former president, pointing to Aso and Japan said ""in Japan, they don’t know about that. They don’t close. They keep it open. They make it work."" 
""The people running Columbia have made a grave mistake,"" Trump said. Columbia University’s updated guidelines, as of Tuesday morning, said all courses on the Morningside main campus have moved to hybrid learning ""until the end of each school’s Spring 2024 semester.""
""Safety is our highest priority as we strive to support our students’ learning and all the required academic operations,"" the school's Provost Angela Olinto wrote in a statement released early Tuesday morning. ""It’s vital that teaching and learning continue during this time.""The announcement comes amid continued antisemitic protests on the New York City campus and just a day after classes were made virtual on Monday.
The guidance, signed in tandem with Chief Operating Officer Cas Holloway, also affects faculty and staff.
The guidance comes amid days of protests at Columbia, where anti-Israel agitators initially formed an encampment — setting up tents and refusing to leave— on the campus last week. The protesters have marched in and around the campus demanding the school lose affiliations with groups that support Israel amid its war with Hamas in Gaza, which has resulted in tens of thousands of civilian deaths.  Columbia University President Dr. Nemat ""Minouche"" Shafik said in a statement posted in the early hours Monday morning, that she was ""deeply saddened"" by certain actions of the agitators and called for a ""reset.""""I am deeply saddened by what is happening on our campus,"" Shafik wrote. ""Our bonds as a community have been severely tested in ways that will take a great deal of time and effort to reaffirm. Students across an array of communities have conveyed fears for their safety and we have announced additional actions we are taking to address security concerns. The decibel of our disagreements has only increased in recent days. These tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas.""Shafik, on Monday, said the university needs ""a reset."" 
More than 100 of the protesters were arrested last week amid the unrest.Antisemitic protests have broken out at colleges and universities across the nation including New York University in New York City and Yale University in New Haven, Ct. ",Real
"WASHINGTON — The Senate voted Tuesday to advance the $95 billion aid package to provide critical aid to Ukraine and a provision that could lead to a nationwide ban on TikTok.
The vote of 80-19 indicates the legislation has enough support to clear the Senate in a final vote, which could come as soon as Tuesday evening, and then head to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law.
The package, which passed the House on Saturday, includes $60 billion in aid to Ukraine that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said would give his country “a chance at victory” against Russia. It includes $26 billion in aid to Israel and humanitarian relief in Gaza, in addition to $8 billion for security in Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific.
And it would give TikTok’s China-based parent company nine months, which the president could extend to a year, to sell the popular social media platform or be banned in the U.S. That puts TikTok closer than ever before to a prohibition while ensuring that it won’t be banned until after the 2024 election.Senators on Tuesday afternoon will discuss whether they can reach a deal to quickly vote to give final passage to the bill later in the day or whether to wait until Wednesday to approve it.
“The finish line is now in sight,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement over the weekend, saying the bill’s passage would be “a watershed moment for the defense of democracy.”Two months ago, the Senate voted 70-29 to pass a similar $95 billion foreign aid package — but without the TikTok provision.
Still, there are signs that the Senate is receptive to the TikTok ban bill, which the House revised.
Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., the chair of the Commerce Committee, endorsed the new bill, saying she’s “very happy” with the extended window for TikTok to be sold. An earlier House-passed bill would have given the parent company six months to sell TikTok. Cantwell noted that she recommended the change.
""I support this updated legislation,"" she said.
Advocates for banning the app in the U.S. express concerns about TikTok’s relationship to ByteDance, a company based in Beijing, saying Americans’ data could, under Chinese law, be accessed by China’s government, a prospect that TikTok has downplayed, saying its headquarters are in Singapore and Los Angeles. They also claim China could manipulate the algorithm to advance propaganda.
A TikTok spokesperson responded to the House’s vote over the weekend by saying, “It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy annually.” 
A source within TikTok said in a memo sent after the House passed the bill that once Biden signs it into law, it ""will move to the courts for a legal challenge.""
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is lobbying his colleagues to reject the package, saying 41 senators could join to filibuster it.
“The $95 billion bill doesn’t have to pass. It takes only 41 senators stop it,” Lee wrote on X. “There are 49 Republicans in the Senate—more than enough. Where do your senators stand?”",Real
"The news of Russia agreeing to sign a peace agreement with Ukraine under specific conditions echoed across the global political landscape, sparking a mixture of relief, skepticism, and concern. The agreement, which stipulated no reparations to be paid and an end to sanctions, signaled a potential end to the years-long conflict that had ravaged Ukraine and strained international relations. However, amidst the cautious optimism surrounding the prospect of peace, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's reaction cast a shadow over the proceedings.

The peace agreement, negotiated through intense diplomatic efforts and behind-the-scenes maneuvering, represented a delicate balancing act between the interests of the conflicting parties. For Russia, the cessation of hostilities and the lifting of sanctions promised a return to a semblance of normalcy, alleviating the economic and geopolitical pressures that had mounted in the wake of the conflict. On the other hand, Ukraine's acceptance of the terms signaled a pragmatic recognition of the reality on the ground – the securing of territory and the restoration of stability were paramount concerns for a nation weary from years of war and uncertainty.

However, as the details of the peace agreement emerged, so too did President Zelenskyy's discontent. While the agreement promised an end to bloodshed and a path towards reconciliation, it came at a cost – the absence of accountability for the perpetrators of atrocities such as the Bucha Massacre. The horrific events in Bucha, where scores of civilians were brutally murdered and their bodies left strewn across the streets, had shocked the world and galvanized calls for justice. Yet, the peace agreement seemed to offer impunity to those responsible, a bitter pill for Zelenskyy and many Ukrainians to swallow.

In a passionate address to the nation, President Zelenskyy expressed his frustration and disappointment at the perceived injustice inherent in the peace agreement. He spoke of the victims of the Bucha Massacre, their voices silenced forever, and the responsibility of the international community to hold accountable those who had committed such heinous crimes. Zelenskyy's words struck a chord with many Ukrainians who had endured the horrors of war and who shared his desire for justice and closure.

The absence of accountability for war crimes and atrocities threatened to undermine the fragile peace agreement, casting doubt on its legitimacy and long-term viability. Zelenskyy's refusal to simply accept the terms of the agreement without addressing this fundamental issue reflected his commitment to upholding the principles of justice and human rights, even in the face of political expediency. His stance resonated with supporters both at home and abroad, who saw in him a champion for the victims of war and a voice for those who had been silenced.

As the international community grappled with the complexities of the peace agreement and its implications for justice and reconciliation, pressure mounted on Russia to address the allegations of war crimes and atrocities committed during the conflict. Calls for an independent investigation into the events in Bucha and other affected areas grew louder, fueled by evidence of atrocities and eyewitness accounts that painted a damning picture of the brutality of war.

In the end, the peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine represented a fragile compromise – a necessary step towards ending the bloodshed and restoring stability to the region. Yet, the absence of accountability for war crimes and atrocities threatened to overshadow the promise of peace, casting a shadow of doubt over the prospects for true reconciliation. As President Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine grappled with the aftermath of war, their quest for justice and closure continued, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity.",Fake
"War experts are advising Ukraine to use its latest $61 billion U.S. aid package cautiously as there is always the possibility that American aid could again be derailed by politics.

""Every fight over every next increment has gotten increasingly contentious and increasingly long,"" said Jennifer Kavanagh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, referring to the months-long deliberation of the most recent package for Ukraine that passed in the Senate on Wednesday and past assistance debates. ""I think that the plan should be what if there is no more money.""

During a Defense Priorities Wednesday discussion panel, experts such as Kelly Grieco, a Stimson Center senior fellow, weighed in, saying that ""everyone involved in this conflict should treat this aid package as though it's the last one and plan accordingly, because that could be.""

The upcoming U.S. presidential election, in which the presumed Republican candidate is far less supportive of Ukraine, as well as the continued divisiveness of the Ukraine security assistance discussion between the political parties in Congress, could complicate the passage of future aid for Ukraine, which has not been brought up yet but almost certainly will as the war drags on.

""It's uncertain who's going to be in office in January,"" Kavanagh said, further remarking that there is ""certainly no appetite for starting the fight over January 2025 now.""

With the U.S. aid that was just approved, some conflict analysts assess that Ukraine's next steps to make the most of the new assistance should include building up defenses and exploring the possibility of negotiating with Russia.

""I think Ukraine can win this war. It cannot win militarily in any way, it can win politically, though,"" Grieco said. ""It can actually gain a political victory by not allowing Putin to achieve his main goal, which is to subjugate Ukraine,"" she said, noting that ""Ukraine can remain a viable state and an independent state from Russia.""

Both Grieco and Kavanagh emphasized the importance of Ukraine showing up to the negotiating table and using diplomacy with Russia to prevent further land losses.

Other experts, as well as Ukrainian officials, are critical of calls for negotiations between Ukraine and Russia and have said that Vladimir Putin would demand the ""demilitarization"" of Ukraine in order to take advantage of it.

Experts of the Washington-based Institute of the Study of War said in a March report that they continue to ""assess that Russian President Vladimir Putin maintains his maximalist objectives in Ukraine, which are tantamount to complete Ukrainian and Western capitulation, and that Russia has no interest in good-faith negotiations with Ukraine.""

ISW has challenged the notion that the war is '""unwinnable"" for Ukraine, calling that a Russian information operation.

Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba has said that Russia cannot be trusted, a reality he says is proven by its documented failures to live up to past negotiations.

He reminded the world last November in a statement on social media that ""Putin is a habitual liar who promised international leaders that he would not attack Ukraine days before his invasion in February 2022."" Kuleba said no one can seriously expect the Ukrainians to negotiate with Russia.

The challenge is that six months of delayed assistance have put Ukraine in a difficult position, one that may not immediately be rectified by the coming aid.

During the panel discussion Wednesday, Kavanagh argued that starting negotiations will also buy Ukraine time as it's expected that the approved US aid will not be flowing in all at once. ""The reality is that politics is involved, which means that things won't be perfect and there will be delays,"" she said.",Real
